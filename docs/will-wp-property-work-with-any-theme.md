Our plug-ins will work with any theme because it follows all WordPress best practices for plugin development. You may encounter styling issues or incompatibilities with poorly created themes or plugins, but nothing about our plugin would prevent it from working as expected. However, please note that we do not guarantee the compatibility of our products and third party themes and plug-ins. 

Here are the free themes that we created especially for WP-Property, these themes are guaranteed to work with all our products: [Avalon](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/product/avalon), [Madison](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/product/madison), [Denali](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/product/denali).
