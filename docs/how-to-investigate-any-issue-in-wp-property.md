Try to do the following things:
- Disable all third party plugins one by one to be sure that the issue is not related to any of them.
- Try to switch the theme to WordPress default one (Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen) to make sure that the issue is not related to the current theme being used. Please note that we do not guarantee compatibility with third party themes/plug-ins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
- Be sure that WordPress and WP-Property versions are up to date. If they are not, please update the software.
