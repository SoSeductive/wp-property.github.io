###XML Object from Raw Data: Looks like the data has errors and can not be converted to XML Object.

If you receive this error:

1. Check your disc space to make sure you have enough.

2. Once you check the disc space, try to increase it as this could be the reason why XML file canâ€™t be saved in full size.
