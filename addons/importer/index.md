### Welcome to the WP-Property: Importer wiki!

This powerful importation tool downloads and attaches images and can even associate properties with real estate agents, on the fly. Once an import schedule has been created, you can literally import hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of properties with a single click.

In addition to simply importing, the XMLI can update and merge data, download images and attach them to listings, associate listings with [real estate agents](https://wp-property.github.io/addons/agents/), geo-locate addresses, and much more.

**Supported Data Formats**

* Extensible Markup Language (XML)
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
* Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
* MLS Listings via Real Estate Transaction Standard (RETS), IDX, CREA
* WP-Property: Semi-automated importing of data from other WP-Property powered websites

The XML Importer receives data using either the XML or RETS import methods. WP-Property, JSON and CSV feeds will be imported using the [XML import method.](https://wp-property.github.io/addons/importer/basic-xml-import-step-by-step-for-wp-property-importer.html) IDX and MLS feeds will be imported using the [RETS import method.](https://wp-property.github.io/addons/importer/basic-rets-import-step-by-step-for-wp-property-importer.html) The XML and RETS tutorials show how to create basic XML and RETS imports. More advanced importations will require knowledge of XPath rule and/or DMQL query construction.
