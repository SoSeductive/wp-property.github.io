There are several ways to process an import:

*   Manually (using the browser),
*   Automatically
    *   by setting up a cron job on your server
    *   using Alternative cron option in your schedule settings. 

For every "Import Schedule" you create, a **Cron Command** field will be displayed, followed by the command you would need to enter into the cron job builder, for the import schedule to be executed.
