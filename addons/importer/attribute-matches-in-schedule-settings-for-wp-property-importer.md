Gives you ability to set up any custom matches for value which returns set Xpath rule in Attribute Map section. So if you have encrypted data in your feed, you can easily decrypt it.

### How to use
Just put which values from your feed should be changed for your prepared ones.

There are some tags which also can be used:

*  [any] - matches any value. Can be used to set your default value. The same as free_text: function.
*  [empty] - matches empty values. E.g., can be used in case you want to import ‘0’ , ‘false’ or some other value instead of empty values
