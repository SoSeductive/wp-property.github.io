1. Download [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to your PC. 
2. Translate the file which is located in "plug-in name"/static/language folder. 
3. Name the translated file accordingly: wp-property-pdf-dk_DK.po  (if this is for wp-property-pdf for dutch translation). Make sure that the abbreviations are correct.
4. Go into the file and save it again, this will automatically create a "mo" file with the same name.

### Important:  
Each translated file should be located in the correct location.

### Example: 
If this is WP-Property the file should be in  wp-property/static/languages and if it is for wp-property-pdf the file should be wp-property-pdf/static/languages.
