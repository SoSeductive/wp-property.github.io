### Welcome to the WP-Property: Responsive Slideshow wiki!

The Responsive Slideshow Add-on is used to aesthetically showcase a series of images. It is easily combine images with different image sizes, so you do not need to puzzle over with image settings.

Slideshow may be inserted virtually anywhere using shortcode, but is generally intended to be displayed on property pages. We made it extremely simple - you have shortcode `[property_responsive_slideshow]` and widget Responsive Slideshow available for you.
