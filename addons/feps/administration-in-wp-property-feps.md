Specific column "FEPS details" can be added to the table on All Properties page. To add this column, you should check the option "Enable Column FEPS Details on All Properties page." in Properties/Settings/FEPS tab.

Column contains detailed FEPS information about the current property, which can be helpful for management.

Note, if the option is enabled but you don't see the column, you should check "Screen Option" settings.
