* **Can I not show a map at all?** Only if you do not show the address attribute at all.  As of now, whenever the address attribute is displayed, the Google Map will be rendered automatically.

* **Can I have submitted listings published automatically?** Yes, when creating the form, set the Property Status to "Publish" and the submitted listings will be made public immediately 

* **Can the number of submitted images be limited?** Yes, during form creation set the Images Limit to a number to set the maximum number of images that can be submitted per listing.

* **Can I use this to list vehicles, or other things?** You can use FEPS to list whatever your heart desires - use the Developer tab in WP-Property to create any attribute you want, and customize away.

* **Can I use this feature on multiple domains?** As with all of our premium features, you purchase a dual-domain license, meaning the feature can be used on two domains.  This is intended so you can have a production and a development environment, but in practice we don't care how you use it - can be two production domains.

* **Is WP-Property needed to use FEPS?** Yes, FEPS is as extension of WP-Property, which must be installed first to use FEPS. WP-Property is free, and can be downloaded from the WordPress repository. 

* **Can I disable email notification?** Yes, you can check "Disable new user account creation notification." on Properties/Property Forms page.

* **Can user remove uploaded photos?** Yes, he needs to click on that photo before using "Publish" button.
