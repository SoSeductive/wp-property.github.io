As the case with most of our premium features, a tab will be added to the Settings page. Within this tab you can configure some of the global Supermap settings, such **Sidebar Attributes**, which is a list of attributes (Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Address, etc.) to be displayed in the **left sidebar** of Supermaps.

Be sure to set your Supermap sidebar thumbnail to something relatively small - we recommend 90px by 90px, if not smaller.

To configure the attributes that are displayed in the popup bubble, visit the Settings -> Display tab, where under Google Maps you can configure the attributes, as well as the size of the thumbnail image inside the popup.

### Map Markers

Allows you to upload different Google Maps custom markers for each property type or single property. Map markers for property types you can set on Properties/Settings/Developer page Property Types table. For single property - on Single Property editing page.
