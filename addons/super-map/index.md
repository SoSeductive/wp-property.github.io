### Welcome to the WP-Property: Super Map wiki!

The Supermap add-on displays an interactive map of your listings, in one convenient place, for your visitors to see. The map is powered by Google Maps, and therefore allows all the standard Google Map features such as zooming, panning, displaying popups, dynamic filtering, and more.

In addition to plotting listings on a map, a sidebar may be displayed allowing visitors to search for listings with each search updating the map in real-time.

You can create and insert as many Supermaps as you'd like, using shortcodes, to include having multiple maps on one page. Additionally, you may also use the Supermap to display search result properties by placing one of the shortcodes on the Default Property Page.
