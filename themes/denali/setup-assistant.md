After you have uploaded and activated Denali, you will get the **First Setup Wizard**, which will automatically create some basic settings for your site. Most of the setting fields are visual, giving you an idea of the result the setting will have on your website. For these, you will have to click on the thumbnail of the option you want to work with, which will be highlighted with a yellow color.

**General Color Scheme**. This will let you choose one of the three color schemes (we prefer to call them "skins"), that come with Denali. You can choose between Default (brownish, earthy tones), Blue (light and dark blue hues with a grey hardwood floor background), and Dark (mostly greyscale with some red here and there).

**Home Page**. This setting will either create a sidebar on your home page, or not, allowing the page's content to take up all 970 pixels of available horizontal space. If you require widgets on your home page, you should choose the second option ("Show a sidebar on home page, and load some widgets in there.").

**Slideshow**. This will set how the Denali slideshow will appear. You can choose between slideshow with search fields, slideshow without search fields and no slideshow at all. Note: you can still create search widgets later, this setting only includes the search widget in the slideshow's enclosing box. Also, if you decide to enable the search widget, you will have to set it up. More on this in the "Widgets" section of this tutorial.

**Property Page**. This setting will enable or disable a full-width slideshow module on the top part of single property pages (pages dedicated to one property, not property overviews). Note that for properties that only have one image, a static image and not a slideshow will appear.

**Best Practices**. These settings create some basic page layouts for you to get you started with Denali and WP-Property. You can always change them later, as you get more familiar with Denali.

**Setup up my homepage, put some properties on there, and a search form for good measure**. This field is mostly self explanatory, it will add a search form and some properties on your home page.

**Setup my property result page with shortcodes and attributes**. This sets up a basic search results page. In most basic cases you wouldn't need to edit that page afterwards.

**Setup the single listing page with all the widgets**. Adds all WP-Property widgets to the single listing page. Helps you see all the widgets, and after you decide which you want, you can remove the rest later.

**Populate widget areas and sidebars with widgets**. This adds sample widgets in all widget areas of the theme. Useful for finding out where you can add widgets.

## Other

**Create a few sample properties**. A very useful setting. This will create some dummy content properties for you, in order to see how a listing is set on the property edit page, and how it shows on the front-end (your website).

**Create a sample agent, a dedicated agent page, and associate with the sample properties**. This will create a sample agent, a page for that agent and associate him with the sample properties created with the previous option. Useful only if you are interested in seeing how the agents premium feature works.

After you are happy with your selections, click on "**Setup my Site**" on the bottom of the page and you are good to start.

Right after completing the First Setup Wizard, you will be redirected to the **Settings UI**. The Settings UI is organized in tabs (General Settings, Header, Footer, Property Overview, Single Content Pages, Inquiry). The default tab that opens automatically is the first one, [**General Settings**](https://wp-property.github.io/themes/denali/denali-theme-settings-general-tab.html).
