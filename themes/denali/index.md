### Get Setup Quickly with the Setup Assistant

After you have uploaded and activated Denali, the [First Setup Wizard](https://wp-property.github.io/themes/denali/setup-assistant.html) page will appear. Jump to the next section of this tutorial.
The Setup Assistant is a point-and-click interface to help you with a quick setup. The assistant will help you select a color scheme, general layout of a property page, location of search widgets, and more. Additionally, the assistant can create some sample properties for you, setup the widgets, and even create a sample real estate agent.

### Element Overview

Denali comes with a series of special elements, to improve functionality, usability and visitors' focus on your website. Here you will learn about these elements and their functionality.

### The Attention Grabber - Tabbed Widgets

Denali comes with a special tabbed element on the homepage, called Attention Grabber. The attention grabber is practically a tabbed widget area, in which you can add whatever widgets you wish, and organize them in tabs. 

Each widget you add on an Attention Grabber will appear as a different tab in it. Also, for each property type you create, another Attention Grabber area will appear for you to add widgets to. More on this on the "Single Content Pages" and "Widgets" section of this tutorial.

### The Slideshow

The Denali's [Slideshow](https://wp-property.github.io/addons/slideshow/) is a special full-width slideshow that can support images plus a widget. Usually, that widget is a Property Search widget. You can later choose which widget you want to add to the Slideshow, if the widget will appear or not, or if you want to completely remove the Slideshow element.

### Header Dropdowns

**Header Dropdowns** are more **dynamic widget areas** that come with Denali. They are tabs that pop under the very top of every page and serve various purposes. Once clicked, these tabs slide down with a smooth effect and display the related widgets. We have three Dropdowns in Denali: **Property Search** (you can never get enough of these), **Contact Us** and **Login**. As their names suggest, one includes a property search widget, one a contact form, and one a username and password field for logging into your website.
