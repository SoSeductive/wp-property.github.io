New Theme releases can be downloaded  from your [UD Account](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/account)

At the moment already available `Denali 4.*.*`

You will need to update theme manually(Download from UD Account and upload to your site). There is a slight change in a method, that is the reason why notifications about new releases of themes will be only available after you will have `Denali 4.*.*`, so after you will update your theme manually(you will need to do this only once), you will start seeing notifications about new releases again.
