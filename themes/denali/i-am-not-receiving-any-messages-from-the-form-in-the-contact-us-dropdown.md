The form uses the same exact function to send out messages used by the rest of WordPress.  If messages are not being received, we strongly advise you to install a SMTP plugin to avoid your message from being spammed, as they usually are when being sent without SMTP.  

There are several SMTP plugins available, we use [Configure SMTP](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/configure-smtp/). Also be sure that the **Send Notifications To** input box on the Denali Settings page has your e-mail address.
