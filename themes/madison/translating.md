#Here are the instructions for translating themes: 

1. Download [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) to your PC. 
2. Translate the file which is located in "theme name"/static/language folder. 
3. Name the translated file accordingly: madison-dk_DK.po (if this is for WP-Madison for dutch translation). Make sure that the abbreviations are correct.
4. Go into the file and save it again, this will automatically create a "mo" file with the same name.
